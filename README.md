## Upgrade Path

### 1.15.0 to 2.0.0

v2.0.0 of this module is built against Terraform v0.12. However, this
introduces a bug that prevents the creation of an ECS service with this
module prior to creation of the cluster which it is going to run on (see
<https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22730>). To work around
this, create the cluster first, and then add the call to this module once
the cluster exists.
